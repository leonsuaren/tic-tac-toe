# Tic-Tac-Toe

> Play with your friends the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, this project was created using React, and I added some simple styles using CSS

## Future Improvements

> In future versions of this project I will add an input to to enter the players name, instead of showing Player 0 ar Player X, I will show the names of each player, and an option to play certain number of games between two players
